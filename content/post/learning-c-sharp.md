Learning .NET has been such an enjoyable experience. Since I started my DevOps journey, I've been mainly using all things Linux and macOS and would dread working with Microsoft Windows servers. I would gripe and complain about how Microsoft is so clunky at every chance.

Fast forward five years.

A month ago, I decided to give .NET a try. I'm using Visual Studios to develop, and I have to say, the developer experience is fantastic. I forgot how much you could learn from working with an IDE. The IDE's suggestions would hint and prevent you from doing stupid things. It's truly a fantastic experience.

I'm working on half-baked Blazor server apps, and I'm having tons of fun learning. Now, to make something, I'll get back to you about that in a future blog post.
